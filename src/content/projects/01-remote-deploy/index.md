Microservice based automation tool built with Golang to **build and deploy** front-end apps on Docker, NGINX.

Kafka is used for the build queue.

1. `wf-collect-client` Microservice will collect the required details like repo public GitHub Url and Build Command to initiate the build process by producing event to kafka
2. `wf-code-builder` this is for processing build events received via Kafka (consumer)
   - Clones the repository from github url received via kafka from wf-collect-client service
   - Generates the Build using the build command
   - Deploys the generated build files
3. MongoDb is being used for logging the events.

For more details about the project check out the pdf file in cwd.

### Tech Stack

- Golang - Two microservices built using Go
- Kafka - Message broker for event-driven communication
- MongoDB - To store the event logs for each build
- Docker Compose - To spin up Kafka and Zookeeper on docker
- Shell Scripting
- Microservices

### Setup

1. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start Apache Kafka & Zookeeper

### Go Lang & Kafka Implementation

- On Kafka, Microservices can publish events
- Microservices can also subscribe to the events(consume)
- Kafka can store events for later retrieval
